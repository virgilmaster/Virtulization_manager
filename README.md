# About the project
This project is not perfect and is in the initial stage. More interesting and practical functions will gradually be added in the next few issues. Why should I write this project? Because I want to quickly improve my expression ability and coding ability, and force myself to keep moving forward. It is too boring to develop alone, and it is very bad to have no partners.
# I hereby declare that I have nothing to do with any accident. This project code has no position.
